# -------------------------
# Ways to specify textures:
# -------------------------
# In order to support not only the simple, single-texture use-case but also
# arbitrary texturing of sides when needed, the system has two conventions to
# specify block texture information:
#
# All sides have the same texture (e.g. dirt, stone)
#
#   texture: ./path/to/asset.png
#
# OR
#
# Different sides have different textures
#
#   texture
#     top: ./path/to/texture-top.png
#     bottom: ./path/to/texture-bottom.png
#     nsew: ./path/to/texture-nsew.png
#
# When a single side has its own texture, the key is the full side spelling.
#
# When multiple sides share a texture, the key is the combined first characters
# of the sides in the order NSEWTB (North South East West Top Bottom).
#
# UPDATE:
# Since I'm eventually going to move reading block data into ruby (at least
# that's the plan...), I'm going to make this file much more verbose for now in
# order to simplify the C++ code that parses it.
#
# Once I do it in ruby, I can go back to my preferred format since it'll be way
# easier to parse in ruby than C++.
